## Introduction

Information and processes managed within IT systems can be exposed to threats that would undermine confidentiality, integrity and availability. The guidance 
throughout this document highlights common pitfalls and strategies to minimise an IT systems vulnerability footprint and ensure reliable performance. 

## Scope

This document is targeted at technical specialists involved in the design, build or acquisition of IT systems for Parks and Wildlife. It aims to provide a 
collection of best practices that will help technical specialists implement reliable and secure systems.

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality refers to protecting information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. In other words, only the people who are authorized to do so can gain access to sensitive data.

## Integrity

Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information (that should be protected against unwarranted disclosure) can only be accessed by authorised users.

## Availability
